**Steps** 

- [X] Setup Development environment: Scala, Spark, Git repo (P, T)
- [X] Update README with Instructions of how to set up dev environment, project details, results, report etc (P, T)
- [X] Create and save datasets using Python
- [X] Solve Tasks (Task1, Task2, Task3) for a toy dataset
- [X] Test solution  using a toy dataset

- [X] Experimentation process - Time solutions:
    - Task (task1, task2, task3)
    - different number of cores (1,2,4,8)
    - distributions (uniform, normal, correlated, anticorrelated)
    - dataset size (10.000, 100.000, 1.000.000)
    - dataset dimensions - number of points (2, 4, 10, 50)
    - k (from topk): 1, 10, 50 , 100
    -> **running time for each experiment**

    Total experiments: 4 x 4 x 3 x 4 x 4  = 256 x 3
  
- [X] Create tables, plots to describe experimentation results
- [X] Write report
- [X] Prepare presentation
- [X] Presentation practice
- [X] Submit assignment
