**Steps** 

- [X] Setup Development environment: Scala, Spark, Git repo (P, T)
- [X] Update README with Instructions of how to set up dev environment, project details, results, report etc (P, T)
- [X] Create and save datasets using Python
- [X] Solve Tasks (Task1, Task2, Task3) for a toy dataset
- [X] Test solution  using a toy dataset

- [ ] Experimentation process - Time solutions:
    - Task (task1, task2, task3)
    - different number of cores (1,2,4,8)
    - distributions (uniform, normal, correlated, anticorrelated)
    - dataset dimensions (10.000, 100.000, 1.000.000)
    - dataset size - number of points (2, 4, 10, 50)
    - k (from topk): 1, 10, 100
    -> **running time for each experiment**

- [ ] Create tables, plots to describe experimentation results
- [ ] Write report
- [ ] Prepare presentation
- [ ] Presentation practice
- [ ] Submit assignment

- [ ] Search for a suitable Real Estate dataset from UCI repository or kaggle (P)
